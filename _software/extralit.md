An open-source platform that helps researchers extract structured data from scientific literature by:

1. Automating extraction of tables, figures, and unstructured text using AI document processing
2. Providing schema-driven extraction with human validation workflows for high accuracy
3. Integrating with existing research workflows for systematic reviews and meta-analyses
4. Creating analysis-ready datasets that maintain complex relationships between data points

Features:
- OCR and table extraction pipeline powered by Vision Transformers
- LLM-assisted structured data extraction with human validation
- Collaborative annotation interface for quality control
- Flexible schema definition for any scientific domain
- Integration with popular data science tools

Built with:
- Document AI: Marker, PyMuPDF, Table-Transformer
- ML/AI: LlamaIndex, Hugging Face Transformers
- Backend: FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch
- Frontend: Vue.js, TypeScript
