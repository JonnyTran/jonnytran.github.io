### Hi there, I'm Nhat Tran, and I also go by Jonny.

I'm a PhD student at the University of Texas at Arlington with a background in computer science. 
My research focuses on the area of bioinformatics with techniques centered around machine learning and data integration. 
More specifically, I research new computational methods for mining multi-omics interactions that aids in understanding of human diseases. 
My goal is to develop new models, techniques, and tools that will enable researchers to unleash the untapped potential of these rich, complex datasets. 
I use machine learning techniques extensively - feel free to check out some of my works!
