# Greetings, my name is Nhat Tran, and I also go by Jonny.

I'm a recent Ph.D. graduate from the University of Texas at Arlington with a background in computer science. 
My research focuses on the area of bioinformatics with techniques centered around graph neural networks and multimodal data integration. 
More specifically, I research new computational methods for combining knowledge graph representation of heterogeneous multi-omics interactions with protein and nucleic acid sequences to aid in the understanding of protein and non-coding RNA functions. 
My goal is to develop new models, techniques, and tools that will enable researchers to unleash the untapped potential of these rich, complex datasets. 
I use machine learning techniques extensively - feel free to check out some of my works!

Personally, I am an avid dancer, BJJ fanatic, and home espresso enthusiast.
