## My name is Nhat Tran, and I also go by Jonny.

I'm a recent CS Ph.D. graduate from the University of Texas at Arlington with a background in machine learning and bioinformatics. 

My research focuses on the area of bioinformatics with techniques centered around graph neural networks and multimodal data integration. More specifically, I research new computational methods for combining sequence representation and heterogeneous network interactions among RNAs sequences to aid in the understanding of non-coding RNA functions. 
My goal is to develop new models, techniques, and tools (see [OpenOmics](https://github.com/JonnyTran/OpenOmics){:target="_blank"}) that will enable researchers to unleash the untapped potential of these rich, complex datasets.

In my off time, I also research about espresso coffee science. I use machine learning techniques extensively - feel free to check out some of my works!

## Research interests
- Graph neural networks (Heterogeneous graph, Graph representation learning)
- Natural language processing (Text classification, Text generation)
- Machine learning (Deep learning, Transfer learning, Multimodal learning)
- Bioinformatics (RNA, Non-coding RNA, RNA-protein interaction, RNA structure)
