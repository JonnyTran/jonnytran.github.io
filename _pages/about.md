Hi there, I'm Jonny Tran.
======
As a final-year Ph.D. student in computer science, I currently contribute to bioinformatics cancer research with techniques centered around machine learning and data integration. My main projects involved developing new deep learning algorithms for predictions on heterogeneous knowledge graph and an open-source software for multi-modal data integration of biological datasets. Along with real-world software engineering experience, I also excel in developing an efficient and reusable code base, adopting data engineering best practices, and learning new big data frameworks.
